## As I Understand Passion

I understand passion as something you need to discover by actively putting in effort. Effort into experimenting with different things till you find that one thing that just clicks, or if nothing clicks, you should go with what you’ve put most hours into and enjoy doing the most.

Fresh out of high school, I had decided I didn’t want to get an engineering degree after learning the harrowing tales of engineering students in India. Instead, I wanted to provide myself with skills and rely on them to break into IT.

My experiments with finding that “one” thing ended after a few years of back & forth…until then I was just really trying to do the best I could with whatever guidance I got (none whatsoever).

I really do think that it is a privilege to be able to “find” or build your passion, not something everybody is able to afford. But my days have led me to this sad truth that not enough people value passion or appreciate it, or spend the energy themselves to find it.

As a student myself, I’ve known many other students from various fields. The vast majority of them chose their Bachelors out of no particular reason, nor did they have the intentions of carving a path out of it. 

- “It just happened to be the college I could afford.”
- “I don’t know, it sounds it has something to do with computers, maybe I’ll take up a few courses to build my skills.” (Never did)
- “Closest to my house, attendance is not mandatory.”
- “Will use it to apply for Masters in the USA.”
- “My father is a Civil engineer, he wants me to be one as well.”

All of this to set the context for why I chose not to do a Masters overseas, while it became  everybody else’s move right after graduating.

## Master’s Degree just for the sake of it

[In a statement released on Thursday, the US Mission in India has said that it has issued a record-breaking 82,000 student visas to Indians in 2022 to date. Indian students have received more US student visas than any other country, including China.](https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/indians-get-more-us-student-visas-than-any-other-country-in-2022-us-embassy-8138257/)

Among these 82k people, I've known at least 10 people who flew to the USA this year...that isn't a very big data set (statistically speaking) for me to forge these opinions, but I’ll do it anyway.

A lot of people that I know who have chosen to do a Masters, usually do little to no research in the program they choose. They completed their Bachelors and are simply unable to find appealing employment opportunities here, so they do the next best thing. A Masters somewhere overseas like Australia, UK, Canada, USA. Some take into account their shot at securing a PR (Permanent Resident), others look for what country has the best money-making policies for students (like hours of work, $s per hour) etc.

To start your process of flying overseas for your Master’s degree, you will approach a consultancy. Some of them do charge a fee for their services, which include, applying to universities, writing your SOP for you, coaxing you into doing your Masters at a particular university in a particular program (incentivized by universities), fake the funds in your bank account that you’re supposed to disclose during your visa filing etcetera, etcetera.

My consultancy advised me that I take a course at a reputed University (high fees) so I don’t get flagged by the visa authorities and that I can “switch” to a more affordable university after I land there.  I was also informed that I could make decent money working odd jobs to pay for the hefty college fees I was about to pay. Some take out loans, others are supported by their parents.

I am not trying to take a shit on these consultancies, a million dollar businesses; they’re providing valuable services. Nor am I saying that people shouldn’t do it, if they can find better employment opportunities and living standards elsewhere, they should go for it.  But it does make me quite suspicious about the whole academic system.  All of it just seems too methodical.

I’ve personally known guys who were passionate about pursuing something before they flew off for their Master’s. It landed them in blue collar (unskilled) jobs that made them decent money (money they’d make in India in a skilled profession). Naturally, they lost interest in that thing they were excited about. Now, their plan is to make as much money as possible doing those menial jobs before they’re deported (there are contingency plans to avoid this) or if they get lucky a PR is handed to them. I know this is totally fine, they can come back home to set up businesses or whatever.

What I find most disconcerting, however, is the loss of Identity Capital.

## Identity Capital

In her book, The Defining Decade; Meg Jay describes Identity Capital as:

>Identity capital is our collection of personal assets. It is the repertoire of individual resources that we assemble over time. These are the investments we make in ourselves, the things we do well enough, or long enough, that they become a part of who we are. Some identity capital goes on a résumé, such as degrees, jobs, test scores, and clubs. Other identity capital is more personal, such as how we speak, where we are from, how we solve problems, how we look. Identity capital is how we build ourselves—bit by bit, over time. Most important, identity capital is what we bring to the adult marketplace. It is the currency we use to metaphorically purchase jobs and relationships and other things we want.

I hope I am not too bold in assuming that folks who follow this “path” that a thousand others are also on are hardly building discernible Identity Capital.

It takes years for people to really figure out what they want to do in their lives, for the fortunate few who do identify where their passion lies, why should they be underemployed for 2 crucial years of their twenties doing something that was part of their ticket to the USA? I am not taking a shit on blue collar jobs, all kinds of labors deserve dignity.

I don't even have that much faith in the Academic system. A lot of the times, a degree is just reduced to be just another criteria in a job description.

 > Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.

— variously attributed[^1]

Ultimately, it’s not about what makes you the most money, but going on your path doing what you love. Most people spend a significant amount of time trying to find what their calling is, but those who have already figured it out, money should be the least of your worries. Granted that not having to worry about money is also a privilege not everybody has.

## Rant (you may skip this)

Apologies for the digression, but the other day, I was having a conversation with a Quality Assurance Lead with over nine years of experience in the IT field. Here's a summary of his arguments:

-   Having an engineering degree (B. Tech) matters for securing high-paying jobs in IT compared to what a graduate with a B.Sc. degree (≥ 3-year programs) can earn.
-   Developers make more money than other roles.
-   Freshers will struggle to find DevOps roles in India because there are mainly "service" based employment opportunities.
-   If you're an aspiring IT professional, forget about work-life balance. There's no such thing, and you're naive to think you can "demand" this as a fresher.
-   Freshers should embrace any opportunities (roles) that come their way, regardless of their interests, as they aren't in a position to "want" or "desire" specific roles.

As a fresher, I take issue with several of these points.

## Standing Up for Personal Choices and Work-Life Balance

You absolutely have the right to desire something as fundamental as work-life balance. There's no shame in striving for it. The key is **balance**; if you're not compromising your work, why should you compromise your personal life? I'm not attacking the "hustle culture," which works for some people and is fine for them. But you should be allowed to enjoy the finer things in life after work. Engaging in activities like hitting the gym, reading a book, or spending time on yourself are things nobody should be criticized for wanting.

Occasionally working overtime and doing graveyard shifts is perfectly acceptable. If your team needs you, you should be there for them. You help meet deadlines because that's what good team players do.

However, some individuals can't seem to understand that it's okay to have an ideal role you want to work in. Unless you have no clue what you're getting into or don't know what you're talking about, why shouldn't you be able to choose your desired role? After all, you've likely put a lot of effort into learning the tools and gaining the knowledge necessary to do the job.

Don't fall prey to underemployment—don't settle for less when you genuinely know your worth.

Granted, this may not be the best strategy when looking to secure a job quickly, but it is a choice you can make—one you will live with. However, it seems some people believe you shouldn't even aspire to it.

It's strange when older individuals you're conversing with begin with a "watch your tone around me" attitude. I understand the importance of doxastic openness[^2] during discussions, but being subservient simply because someone is older is just unreasonable.

Why do some people think that dismissing a younger person's perspective by calling them names is the way to go when offering advice? It's as if they're saying, "Look at me, I'm older than you, so I must act as if I'm too cool to even engage in a conversation with you. I've seen the world, and I can disregard everything you say as nonsense, label you as 'toxic' instead of presenting a solid argument, and you can't stop me because you're supposed to respect your elders regardless of how terrible their advice is."

Regarding having an engineering degree, I truly believe it doesn't matter as long as you have a degree in CS or a related field and possess the skills to back it up. After all, a degree is just one of many criteria hiring managers and recruiters consider when hiring people. The objective should be to land an interview and excel in it.

SDE roles earning more money than any other IT roles? Well, good for them. I can choose to pursue whatever I find enjoyable and interesting. I'm not in a rat race to earn the most money possible.

In conclusion, it's essential to remember that everyone has the right to pursue their passions, seek work-life balance, and choose the career path they find most fulfilling. Disregarding others' opinions or belittling them for their choices doesn't lead to productive conversations or personal growth.

While the tone and mood of this article may come across as disgruntled, my sincere intention is to emphasize how the current state of the education system has stifled individuality. Ideally, we should have more people pursuing careers in science or other fields that truly interest them. However, we have inadvertently fostered a culture of shortcuts, which has extinguished countless passions in pursuit of material success. This widely followed "template" has dismantled childhood dreams and thrust people into a relentless rat race.
