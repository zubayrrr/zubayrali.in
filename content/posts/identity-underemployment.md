The other day, I was having a discussion with a certain Quality Assurance Lead with 9+ years of experience in the IT field. Here’s a gist of his argument:

- Having an engineering degree (B.tech) matters in getting a high paying job in IT, compared to what a graduate with B.Sc. degree(≥ 3 year programs) can make.
- Devs make more money than any other roles.
- Freshers will have a hard time finding a job in India in DevOps role because in India you will mostly find “service” based employment opportunity.
- If you’re someone who is aspiring to work in IT; you should pretty much forget having a work-life balance. There’s no such thing as that, and you’re a fool to even think you can “demand” something like this as a fresher.
- Freshers should welcome whatever opportunities (roles) that come their way, regardless of whether it interests them or not, and you’re really not in a position (as a fresher) to “want”, “desire” specific roles.

I have a _few_ problems with these arguments (as a fresher).

You absolutely have the right to want something as basic as work-life balance. It is nothing to be ashamed of and everything to strive for. The keyword is **balance**; as long as you’re not shortcoming in your work – why should you in your life? I am not trying to attack the “hustle culture”, it works for some people, and it's fine for them. But you should be allowed to enjoy the finer things in life afterwork. Like hitting the gym, reading a book, giving time to yourself is something nobody should be put down for wanting.

Why is it not acceptable to have an ideal role that you want to work in — unless you’ve no idea what you’re getting yourself into, or if you don’t even know what you’re talking about — why can’t you decide what you want to work in? After all, you must’ve spent a considerable amount of work and energy into learning the tools and acquiring the knowledge to get the job.

Granted that it may not be the best strategy when you’re looking to get employed ASAP, but it is at least a choice that you can make, one you will live with, but apparently you can’t even aspire for it.

I really find it weird when older dudes who you’re in a conversation with start with “watch your tone around me” vibe. I understand that you should have Doxastic openness[^1]

[^1]: Doxastic openness is a technical term related to humility that basically means “I am willing to change my beliefs based on a new or better understanding of evidence”.
