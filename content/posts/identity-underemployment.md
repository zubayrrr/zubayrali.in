The other day, I was having a discussion with a certain Quality Assurance Lead with 9+ years of experience in the IT field. Here’s a gist of his argument:

- Having an engineering degree (B.tech) matters in getting a high paying job in IT, compared to what a graduate with B.Sc. degree(≥ 3 year programs) can make.
- Devs make more money than any other roles.
- Freshers will have a hard time finding a job in India in DevOps role because in India you will mostly find “service” based employment opportunity.
- If you’re someone who is aspiring to work in IT; you should pretty much forget having a work-life balance. There’s no such thing as that, and you’re a fool to even think you can “demand” something like this as a fresher.
- Freshers should welcome whatever opportunities (roles) that come their way, regardless of whether it interests them or not, and you’re really not in a position (as a fresher) to “want”, “desire” specific roles.

I have a _few_ problems with these arguments (as a fresher).

You absolutely have the right to want something as basic as work-life balance. It is nothing to be ashamed of and everything to strive for. The keyword is **balance**; when you’re not shortcoming in your work — why should you in your life? I am not trying to attack the “hustle culture”, it works for some people, and it's fine for them. But you should be allowed to enjoy the finer things in life afterwork. Like hitting the gym, reading a book, giving time to yourself are things nobody should be put down for wanting.

Working overtime and doing graveyard shifts occasionally is absolutely fine. If your team needs you, you be there for them. You help meet deadlines because that's what good team players are.

Why is it not acceptable to have an ideal role that you want to work in — unless you’ve no idea what you’re getting yourself into, or if you don’t even know what you’re talking about — why can’t you decide what you want to work in? After all, you must’ve put a considerable amount of work and energy into learning the tools and acquiring the knowledge to do the job.

Don't fall into the traps of underemployment — don't settle for less when you truly understand your worth.

Granted that it may not be the best strategy when you’re looking to get employed ASAP, but it is at least a choice that you can make, one you will live with, but apparently you can’t even aspire for it.

I really find it weird when older dudes who you’re in a conversation with start with “watch your tone around me” vibe. I understand that you should have doxastic openness[^1] whenever you're in a discussion but being subservient just because they're older to you is just plain stupid.

Why do rude assholes think that dismissing someone's POV by calling them names is the way to go when advising someone younger than you? hooo look at me I am older than you I must act cool as fuck by pretending it's tiring to even have a conversation. I've seen the world and I must disregard everything you say as nonsense, call you "toxic" instead of putting forth a good argument and you can't stop me because you're supposed to respect your elders no matter how dogshit their advice is.

As far as having an engineering degree is concerned, I really don't think it matters as long as you have a degree in CS or in related field and have the skills to back you up. After all, a degree is just one of many criteria hiring managers/recruiters look for when hiring people. The goal should be to get an interview and ace it.

Devs make more money than any other IT roles? Ah man, good for them. I can choose to do whatever I find fun and interesting. I am not in a rat race here to make the most money possible. Shit, it took you 8 years to move from QA to Dev. I mean, DevOps engineers literally make development possible, they bring as much value to an organization as a Dev.

> Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.

— variously attributed[^2]

Ultimately, its not about what makes you the most money but you going on your path doing what you love. Most people spend a significant amount of time trying to find what their calling is but those who have already figured it out, money should be the least of your worries. Granted that not having to worry about money is also a privilege not everybody has.

[^1]: Doxastic openness is a technical term related to humility that basically means “I am willing to change my beliefs based on a new or better understanding of evidence”.
