I understand passion as something you need to discover by actively putting in effort. Effort into experimenting with different things till you find that one thing that just clicks, or if nothing clicks, you should go with what you enjoy doing the most.

Fresh out of high school, I had decided I didn’t want to get an engineering degree after learning the harrowing tales of engineering students in India. Instead, I wanted to provide myself with skills and rely on them to break into it. 

My experiments with finding that “one” thing did end after a few years…until then I was just really trying to do the best I could with whatever guidance I got (none whatsoever).

I really do think that it is a privilege to be able to “find” or build your passion, not something everybody is able to afford. But my days have led me to this sad truth that not enough people value passion or appreciate it, or spend the energy themselves to find it.

As a student myself, I’ve known many other students from various fields. The vast majority of them chose their Bachelors out of no particular reason, nor did they have the intentions of carving a path out of it. 

“It just happened to be the college I could afford.”
“I don’t know, it sounds it has something to do with computers, maybe I’ll take up a few courses to build my skills.” (Never did)
“Closest to my house, attendance is not mandatory.”
“Will use it to apply for Masters in the USA.”
“My father is a Civil engineer, he wants me to be one as well.”

All of this to set the context for why I chose not to do a Masters overseas, while it became  everybody else’s move right after graduating.

[In a statement released on Thursday, the US Mission in India has said that it has issued a record-breaking 82,000 student visas to Indians in 2022 to date. Indian students have received more US student visas than any other country, including China.](https://indianexpress.com/article/education/study-abroad/indians-get-more-us-student-visas-than-any-other-country-in-2022-us-embassy-8138257/)

Among these 82k people, I've known at least 10 people who flew to the USA this year...that isn't a very big data set (statistically speaking) for me to forge these opinions.

A lot of people that I know who have chosen to do a Masters, usually do little to no research for the program they choose. They completed their Bachelors and are simply unable to find appealing employment opportunities here, so they do the next best thing. A Masters somewhere overseas like Australia, UK, Canada, USA. Some take into account their shot at securing a PR (Permanent Resident), others look for what country has the best money-making policies as a student (like hours of work, $s per hour) etc.

If you want to start your process of flying overseas for your degree, you will approach a consultancy. Some of them do charge a fee for their services, which include, applying to universities, writing an SOP for you, coaxing you into doing your Masters at a particular university in a particular program(incentivized by universities), fake the funds in your bank account that you’re supposed to disclose during your visa filing etcetera, etcetera.

My consultancy advised me that I take a course at a reputed University (high fees) so I don’t get flagged by the visa authorities and that I can “switch” to a more affordable university after I land there.  I was also informed that I could make decent money working odd jobs to pay for the hefty college fees I was about to pay. Some take out loans, others are supported by their parents.

I am not trying to take a shit on these consultancies, a million dollar businesses. They’re providing valuable services. But it does make me quite sus(picious) about the whole academic system. 

I’ve personally known guys who were passionate about pursuing something before they flew off for Masters. It landed them in blue collar (unskilled) jobs that made them decent money (money they’d make in India in a skilled profession). Naturally, they lost interest in that thing they were excited about. Now, their plan is to make as much money as possible before they’re deported (there are contingency plans to avoid this) or if they get lucky a PR is handed to them. I know this is totally fine, they can come back home to set up businesses or whatever.

But what I don’t feel okay about is the loss of Identity Capital.

## Identity Capital

In her book, The Defining Decade; Meg Jay describes Identity Capital as:

>Identity capital is our collection of personal assets. It is the repertoire of individual resources that we assemble over time. These are the investments we make in ourselves, the things we do well enough, or long enough, that they become a part of who we are. Some identity capital goes on a résumé, such as degrees, jobs, test scores, and clubs. Other identity capital is more personal, such as how we speak, where we are from, how we solve problems, how we look. Identity capital is how we build ourselves—bit by bit, over time. Most important, identity capital is what we bring to the adult marketplace. It is the currency we use to metaphorically purchase jobs and relationships and other things we want.


I hope I am not too bold in assuming that folks who follow this “path” that a thousand others are also on are hardly building discernible Identity Capital.


It takes years for people to really figure out what they want to do in their lives, for the fortunate few who do identify where their passion lies, why should they be underemployed for 2 crucial years of their twenties doing something that was part of their ticket to the USA? I am not taking a shit on blue collar jobs, all kinds of labors deserve dignity.

I don't even have that much faith in the Academic system. A lot of the times, a degree is just reduced to be just another criteria in a job description.

The other day, I was having a discussion with a certain Quality Assurance Lead with 9+ years of experience in the IT field. Here’s a gist of his argument:

- Having an engineering degree (B.tech) matters in getting a high paying job in IT, compared to what a graduate with B.Sc. degree(≥ 3 year programs) can make.
- Devs make more money than any other roles.
- Freshers will have a hard time finding a job in India in DevOps role because in India you will mostly find “service” based employment opportunity.
- If you’re someone who is aspiring to work in IT; you should pretty much forget having a work-life balance. There’s no such thing as that, and you’re a fool to even think you can “demand” something like this as a fresher.
- Freshers should welcome whatever opportunities (roles) that come their way, regardless of whether it interests them or not, and you’re really not in a position (as a fresher) to “want”, “desire” specific roles.

I have a _few_ problems with these arguments (as a fresher).

You absolutely have the right to want something as basic as work-life balance. It is nothing to be ashamed of and everything to strive for. The keyword is **balance**; when you’re not shortcoming in your work — why should you in your life? I am not trying to attack the “hustle culture”, it works for some people, and it's fine for them. But you should be allowed to enjoy the finer things in life afterwork. Like hitting the gym, reading a book, giving time to yourself are things nobody should be put down for wanting.

Working overtime and doing graveyard shifts occasionally is absolutely fine. If your team needs you, you be there for them. You help meet deadlines because that's what good team players are.

But this thick skull couldn’t grasp that it is okay to have an ideal role that you want to work in — unless you’ve no idea what you’re getting yourself into, or if you don’t even know what you’re talking about — why can’t you decide what you want to work in? After all, you must’ve put a considerable amount of work and energy into learning the tools and acquiring the knowledge to do the job.

Don't fall into the traps of underemployment — don't settle for less when you truly understand your worth.

Granted that it may not be the best strategy when you’re looking to get employed ASAP, but it is at least a choice that you can make, one you will live with, but apparently you can’t even aspire for it.

I really find it weird when older dudes who you’re in a conversation with start with “watch your tone around me” vibe. I understand that you should have doxastic openness[^1] whenever you're in a discussion, but being subservient just because they're older to you is just plain stupid.

Why do rude assholes think that dismissing someone's POV by calling them names is the way to go when advising someone younger than you? Hooo look at me, I am older than you, I must act cool as fuck by pretending it's tiring to even have a conversation with you. I've seen the world and I must disregard everything you say as nonsense, call you "toxic" instead of putting forth a good argument, and you can't stop me because you're supposed to respect your elders no matter how dogshit their advice is.

As far as having an engineering degree is concerned, I really don't think it matters as long as you have a degree in CS or in a related field and have the skills to back you up. After all, a degree is just one of many criteria hiring managers/recruiters look for when hiring people. The goal should be to get an interview and ace it.

SDE roles make more money than any other IT roles? Ah man, good for them. I can choose to do whatever I find fun and interesting. I am not in a rat race to make the most money possible. Shit, it took you 8 years to move from QA to Dev. I mean, DevOps engineers literally make development possible, they bring as much value to an organization as a Dev.

> Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.

— variously attributed[^2]

Ultimately, it’s not about what makes you the most money, but going on your path doing what you love. Most people spend a significant amount of time trying to find what their calling is, but those who have already figured it out, money should be the least of your worries. Granted that not having to worry about money is also a privilege not everybody has.

I know the tone and mood of this entire article reads like someone butt hurt wrote it, but I sincerely just think that the state of the education system has killed individuality We could’ve had more people working in science or whatever field that interests them, but we ended up enabling this [not so] shortcut culture that has killed millions of passions for material successes. This stock “template” that everybody is following has unmade childhood dreams and has pushed them into a rat race.
